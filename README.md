                <h1>Practical Application of Finance and Accounting Knowledge</h1>
                <h3>FIN 500 - Finance and Accounting Skills for Managers</h3>
                <h3>Presented by Sam Baimirzaev</h3>

            <!-- Slide 2 -->
            <section>
                <h2>Key Concepts I Apply</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>WACC: Helps understand the cost of financing and investments.</li>
                    <li>Risk Management: Ensures claims and compliance decisions minimize losses.</li>
                    <li>Budgeting and Forecasting: Guides efficient resource management in claims handling.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 3 -->
            <section>
                <h2>WACC in Claims and Compliance</h2>
                <p>I use WACC to make decisions on settling or defending claims. If defending a claim costs more than our WACC, itâ€™s often better to settle. In compliance, WACC helps assess investments in software or training.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 4 -->
            <section>
                <h2>Risk Management in My Current Role</h2>
                <p>Risk management is key in both claims handling and compliance. It helps assess financial risks and prevent fines or penalties, ensuring the firm's financial stability.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 5 -->
            <section>
                <h2>Budgeting and Forecasting in My Role</h2>
                <p>Budgeting ensures we have enough reserves for claims payouts, and forecasting helps predict financial trends to ensure the firm is prepared for any fluctuations.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 6 -->
            <section>
                <h2>Applying These Concepts in My Future Career</h2>
                <p>Moving forward, I plan to use WACC, risk management, and budgeting as key tools to guide decision-making and contribute to the financial success of my future roles in claims handling or management.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 7 -->
            <section>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The finance and accounting concepts from this course have been instrumental in my current role as a Claims Handler and Compliance Manager Assistant. These tools will continue to shape my career moving forward.</p>
